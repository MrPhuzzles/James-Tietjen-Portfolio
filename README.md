# James Tietjen Portfolio

## About this page

In a short sumamry this page is my personal portfolio for my most recent work to be showcased to employers, future clients and lastly friends and family that want to see what I do with most of my time!
The page is going to start fairly basic, a navigation bar that takes you to specific sections. Clear and concise sections split up in a clean and modern look. 
As a work in progress project I will slowly add features to the site as I learn them and find them pertinent to the page and it aesthetics.
Below I will have some screen shots of the finished site as well as a link to access said page. This document will be updated as the site is built.
