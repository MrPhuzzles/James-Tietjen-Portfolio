# James Tietjen Portfolio

## About this page

In a short sumamry this page is my personal portfolio for my most recent work to be showcased to employers, future clients and lastly friends and family that want to see what I do with most of my time!
The page is going to start fairly basic, a navigation bar that takes you to specific sections. Clear and concise sections split up in a clean and modern look. 
As it is a work in progress project, I will slowly add features to the site as I learn them and find them pertinent to the page and it aesthetics.
Below are some screenshots of the first launch of the page and a link to view it as well!

## Thoughts after building the site
Overall I am happy with what I produced for this site considering the little time spent on it. Ultimately that is my fault as I should have prepared more for the challenge. Sadly working full time has taken it's toll this week and has impacted the time I 
can spend on the porjects. This is something that will not be happening going forward.
Having said that, this project as mentioned above is an ogoing concept and will constantly be updated as I learn new skills and work on existing skills. Please enjoy the site and all feedback is welcomed!
